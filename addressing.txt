Recognized forms:

  OPER Rj,ADDR        direct memory addressing
  OPER Rj,Ri          direct register addressing
  OPER Rj,=ADDR       immediate operand
  OPER Rj,@ADDR       indirect memory addressing
  OPER Rj,@Ri         indirect memory addressing
  OPER Rj,ADDR(Ri)    indexed addressing
  OPER Rj,=ADDR(Ri)   indexed immediate operand
  OPER Rj,@ADDR(Ri)   indexed indirect memory addressing      

actually only three forms for the second operand:

=Addr(Rn) - mode 0
 Addr(Rn) - mode 1
@Addr(Rn) - mode 2

i.e. the last three. The rest are just syntax sugar. So:

ADDR  => Addr(R0)
Ri    => =0(Ri)		(*)
=Addr => =Addr(R0)
@Addr => @Addr(R0)
@Ri   => 0(Ri)

(*) However, for the POP instruction, the Ri form is the only one allowed.
Therefore the parser should somehow keep track of the difference between Rn and
=0(Rn). Also, it would be useful to track explicit usage of the register R0 as
an index register.
